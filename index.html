	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<img src="assets/images/profile_pic.png" alt="Profile Picture">

	<p>I work full time as a systems analyst for a mid-sized law firm in Downtown San Diego. I plan on becoming a web designer extraordinaire as soon as feasibly possible and hope to some day start my own business. I have a computer science degree and have been working in the tech industry for roughly five years.</p>

	<p>On my free time, you are most likely to see me at a music festival. I love EDM, hip hop, and alternative rock music. I also enjoy dancing salsa and bachata even though I'm not very good at it. I have a strange addiction to Youtube and Netflix yet I am also very outgoing. I am also addicted to beer. Boxing is my favorite sport, I even have an undefeated record of 0-0-0. Most people who know me would describe me as the cool, calm, and collected type, which is quite accurate. I consider myself an outgoing introvert, but please don't hesitate to say hello!</p>
